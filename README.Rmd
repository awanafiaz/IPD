With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), researchers from a wide range of disciplines increasingly use predictions from pre-trained algorithms as outcome variables in statistical analyses. However, reifying algorithmically-derived values as measured outcomes may lead to biased estimates and anti-conservative inference ([Hoffman et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08702)). The statistical challenges encountered when drawing inference on predicted data (IPD) include: 

1. Understanding the relationship between predicted outcomes and their true, unobserved counterparts
2. Quantifying the robustness of the AI/ML models to resampling or uncertainty about the training data
3. Appropriately propagating both bias and uncertainty from predictions into downstream inferential tasks

Several works have proposed methods for IPD, including post-prediction inference (PostPI) by [Wang et al., 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.2001238117), prediction-powered inference (PPI) and PPI++ by [Angelopoulos et al., 2023a](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi6000) and [Angelopoulos et al., 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01453), and assumption-lean and data-adaptive post-prediction inference (POP-Inf) by [Miao et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14220). To enable researchers and practitioners interested in these state-of-the-art methods, we have developed `IPD`, a open-source `R` package that implements these methods under the umbrella of IPD.

This README provides an overview of the package, including installation instructions, basic usage examples, and links to further documentation. The examples show how to generate data, fit models, and use custom methods provided by the package.

## Installation

To install the development version of `IPD` from [GitHub](https://github.com/awanafiaz/IPD), you can use the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = F}
#-- Install devtools if it is not already installed

install.packages("devtools")   

#-- Install the IPD package from GitHub

devtools::install_github("awanafiaz/IPD")
```

## Usage

We provide a simple example to demonstrate the basic use of the functions included in the `IPD` package.

### Example Setup

1. We have two datasets: a labeled dataset, \(\mathcal{L} = \left\{Y^\mathcal{L}, X^\mathcal{L}, f\left(X^\mathcal{L}\right)\right\}\), and an unlabeled dataset, \(\left\{X^\mathcal{U}, f\left(X^\mathcal{U}\right)\right\}\). The labeled set is typically smaller in size compared to the unlabeled set. 
2. We have access to an algorithm \(f(X)\) that can predict our outcome of interest \(Y\).
3. Our interest is in performing inference on a quantity such as the outcome mean or quantile, or to recover a downstream inferential (mean) model:

$$\mathbb{E}\left[Y^{\mathcal{U}} \mid \boldsymbol{X}^{\mathcal{U}}\right] = g^{-1}\left(\boldsymbol{X}^{\mathcal{U}'}\beta\right),$$

where \(\beta\) is a vector of regression coefficients and \(g(\cdot)\) is a given link function, such as the identity link for linear regression, the logistic link for logistic regression, or the log link for Poisson regression. However, we do not observe \(Y^\mathcal{U}\), only the predicted \(f(X^\mathcal{U})\). We can use methods for IPD to obtain corrected estimates and standard errors when we replace these unobserved \(Y^\mathcal{U}\) by \(f(X^\mathcal{U})\).

### Data Generation

You can generate synthetic datasets for different types of regression models using the provided `simdat` function. The function currently supports "mean", "quantile", "ols", "logistic", and "poisson" models.

```{r example}
#-- Load the IPD Library

library(IPD)

#-- Generate Example Data for Linear Regression

set.seed(12345)

dat <- simdat(c(10000, 500, 1000), effect = 1, sigma_Y = 1, model = "ols")

head(dat[dat$set == "training",])

head(dat[dat$set == "labeled",])

head(dat[dat$set == "unlabeled",])

```



```{r plot}

library(tidyverse)

library(patchwork)

dat_labeled <- dat[dat$set == "labeled",]

p1 <- dat_labeled |> ggplot(aes(x = X1, y = Y)) + geom_point()

p2 <- dat_labeled |> ggplot(aes(x = X1, y = f)) + geom_point()

p3 <- dat_labeled |> ggplot(aes(x = f, y = Y)) + geom_point()

p1 + p2 + p3

```




### Model Fitting

You can fit the various IPD methods to your data and obtain summaries using the provided wrapper function, `ipd()`:

#### 1.1) PostPI Bootstrap Correction (Wang et al., 2020)

```{r postpi_boot_ols}
#-- Specify the Formula

formula <- Y - f ~ X1

#-- Fit the PostPI Bootstrap Correction

nboot <- 200

IPD::ipd(formula, 
         
  method = "postpi_boot", model = "ols", data = dat, label = "set", 
  
  nboot = nboot)
```

#### 1.2) PostPI Analytic Correction (Wang et al., 2020)

```{r postpi_analytic_ols}
#-- Fit the PostPI Analytic Correction

IPD::ipd(formula, 
         
  method = "postpi_analytic", model = "ols", data = dat, label = "set")
```


#### 2. Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI; Angelopoulos et al., 2023)

```{r ppi_ols}
#-- Fit the PPI Correction

IPD::ipd(formula, 
         
  method = "ppi", model = "ols", data = dat, label = "set")
```

#### 3. PPI++ (Angelopoulos et al., 2023)

```{r ppi_plusplus}
#-- Fit the PPI++ Correction

IPD::ipd(formula, 
         
  method = "ppi_plusplus", model = "ols", data = dat, label = "set")
```

#### 4. Assumption-Lean and Data-Adaptive Post-Prediction Inference (POP-Inf; Miao et al., 2023)

```{r popinf}
#-- Fit the POP-Inf Correction

IPD::ipd(formula, 
         
  method = "popinf", model = "ols", data = dat, label = "set")
```

### Printing and Tidying

The package also provides custom print, summary, tidy, glance, and augment methods to facilitate easy model inspection:

```{r methods}

#-- Fit the PostPI Bootstrap Correction

nboot <- 200

fit_postpi <- IPD::ipd(formula, 
         
  method = "postpi_boot", model = "ols", data = dat, label = "set", 
  
  nboot = nboot)
  
#-- Print the Model

print(fit_postpi)

#-- Summarize the Model

summ_fit_postpi <- summary(fit_postpi)
  
#-- Print the Model Summary

print(summ_fit_postpi)

#-- Tidy the Model Output

tidy(fit_postpi)

#-- Get a One-Row Summary of the Model

glance(fit_postpi)

#-- Augment the Original Data with Fitted Values and Residuals

df <- dat[which(dat$set != "training"),]

augmented_df <- augment(fit_postpi, data = df)

head(augmented_df)
```
